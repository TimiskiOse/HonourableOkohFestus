          <p className="text-sm font-playfair">
            Ika South Local Government Area in Delta State, Nigeria, is an
            administrative division created to improve local governance and
            service delivery. It's home to the Ika people, who are an Igbo
            subgroup primarily found in Delta and Edo States. The Ika people are
            a mix of different tribes that gradually formed their distinct
            identity. While many Ika people are Christians, traditional
            practices are still common among older generations.
